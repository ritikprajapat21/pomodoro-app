        What is Pomodoro Technique?
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-5 tracking-wide opacity-70 text-lg">
        The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more
        productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break
        down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated
        by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian
        word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo
        used as a university student.
